#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

    O(n^2)
    For the while loop on line 10 to break, the code on line 11 will have to run "n" number of times in order to break the while loop.
    Since mulitpication is the same as adding a certain number of times.

    3 * 5 is the same as 3+3+3+3+3

b)

    O(n log n)

    O(n) because the loop is directly related to the size of n
    O(log n) becuase the while loop runs only a sq rt # of times of the size of n

    The while loop on line 19 will run square root of n(rounded up), number of times for each iteration on the range of n.


c)

    O(n)

    The run time of this function is directly relevant to the size of n. It will run the same amount of times as the size of n.
    Line 29 shows the size of n decreasing by 1 each iteration or recursion call.
